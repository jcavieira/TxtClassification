# TxtClassification 

The **TxtClassification** may help you to perform text classification in a parsimonious way using traditional methods, such as: Decision Tree, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, SVM and Neural Network. 

## First things first... **Instalation** ðŸ“¦

If you don't have a *devtools* package installed, install first:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```
Once installed, now you need to install our package:

```r
devtools::install_github("jcavieira/TxtClassification")
```

There is another way to install the package, using the *remotes* package:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jcavieira/TxtClassification")
```
